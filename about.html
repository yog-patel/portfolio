            <p>
                Hello there! I'm Yog Ketan Patel, a passionate Computer Science student at Dalhousie University.
                With a fervent interest in software development and a drive for innovation,
                I am constantly seeking opportunities to push the boundaries of what technology can achieve.
                <br><br>
                Currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, I've had the privilege of immersing myself
                in a diverse range of courses, from software development to data structures and algorithms.
                Having completed several semesters and gained valuable co-op experience,
                I bring a solid foundation of technical knowledge combined with practical industry insights.
                <br><br>
                As I continue my academic journey and prepare to embark on future work terms, I remain dedicated to
                honing my craft
                and exploring new frontiers in technology. My ultimate goal is to contribute meaningfully to the
                ever-evolving landscape of software development and make a positive impact through innovation.
            </p>
